Amber, STM version
==================

Amber working on the STM: WIP.

This is a showcase project of functional design and functional programming in C++.
Simple sandbox game 'Amber' based on ideas of 'The Chronicles of Amber' by R. Zelazny.

Code contains:
- Functional design using functions and lambdas;
- Functions and composition.
- Combinatorial eDSL built on lambdas;
- Maybe monad usage.

Installation
------------

Run in the project dir:

```bash
git clone --branch stm git@github.com:graninas/cpp_functional_core.git ./lib/cpp_functional_core
git clone --branch stm git@github.com:graninas/cpp_monads.git ./lib/cpp_monads
git clone --branch stm git@github.com:graninas/cpp_lenses.git ./lib/cpp_lenses
git clone --branch stm git@github.com:graninas/cpp_stm.git ./lib/cpp_stm
```

Then build with Qt.
