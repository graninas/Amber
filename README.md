Amber
=====

This is a showcase project of the functional design on C++. The C++ User Group it is intended for will happen on November 29th, 2014.

It is a simple sandbox game 'Amber' based on ideas of 'The Chronicles of Amber' by R. Zelazny.

The code contains:
- Design on functions and lambdas;
- Combinatorial eDSL built on lambdas;
- Maybe-like code and also, naturally, a Maybe monad;
- Lightweight Lenses prototype.
